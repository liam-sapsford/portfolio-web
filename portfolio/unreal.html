      <p class="portfolio">RUNNER'S GAMBIT: easily my most successful project, and also the one I'm most proud of. I was lead designer (and lead programmer, lead artist, zzz...) in this group project. My contributions are too numerous to list, but I definitely couldn't have done it solo.

    <p class="portfolio">DATA VISUALIZATION: we were tasked with displaying tens of different objects in the same category in a novel way. I chose PSX games, and decided to show them off in an authentic PSX demo disc aesthetic

      <p class="portfolio">BAD TRIP: this was my first Unreal project. My contributions were more behind the scenes this time, basically covering all gameplay programming. It's rough, but our group was proud of the result at the time

    <p class="portfolio">LINEAR MEDIA IN UNREAL: an interesting application of the engine. we were tasked with creating a piece of linear media (an animation in this case). It's not my best animation efforts, but I really learned a lot from this project
