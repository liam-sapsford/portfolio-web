        hi!
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        lately I've been into 3d art, so that is what the bulk of my most recent works are (ergo, what I'm willing to show off...), but I also like logo/graphic design, as well as game dev
        <br><br>
        my aesthetic is mostly informed by videogames, particularly ones made in the 90s and early 00s, but I'm always keen to try something different so I try not to box myself in!
