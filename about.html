        hi!
        <br><br>
        I'm a media design graduate with a passion for creating
        <br><br>
        lately I've been super into 3d art, so that is what the bulk of my most recent works are (ergo, what I'm willing to show off...), but I've been known to dabble in a bit of logo design and game development as well
        <br><br>
        my aesthetic is mostly informed by videogames, particularly ones made in the 90s and early 00s, but I'm always keen to try something different so I try not to box myself in!
